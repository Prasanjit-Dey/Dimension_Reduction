# Studying the Impact of Dimensionality Reduction on Rainfall Prediction


### Executive Summary:
The amount of rainfall has an effect on a variety of businesses and sectors, including logistics, building, the tourism industry, medical care, and the protection of wildlife. Accurate weather forecasting is crucial for reducing the negative effects of precipitation on these sectors.  In addition, the curse of dimensionality can negatively affect the model's accuracy and result in overfitting. Consequently, the present research suggests employing methods for reducing dimensionality to guarantee that only important characteristics are utilized for rainfall prediction. The application of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with dimensionality reduction improves the precision of rainfall forecasts.
